This is a good example of how dots and dashes are timed, and how symbols, letters, and words are spaced out in Morse Code. It also shows the word "PARIS " which is the default word for measuring an encoder's speed in Words Per Minute (WPM). WPM is measured as the number of times the encoder can play "PARIS " (including the space) in a minute.
