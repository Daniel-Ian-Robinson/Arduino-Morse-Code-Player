## Notes

###### Words Per Minute
This code measures words per minute (WPM) as the number of times the buzzer can play the word "PARIS " (including the space at the end) in a minute. This is a standard measure. "PARIS " takes 50 time units to key as illustrated by the following image from [Test and Measurement Tips](https://www.testandmeasurementtips.com/morse-code-the-first-serial-communication-protocol/).
