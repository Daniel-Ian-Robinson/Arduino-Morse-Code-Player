# Arduino Morse Code Player
This project plays a piece of text in Morse Code using a buzzer and an LED on an Arduino Uno board.

## Required Components
- Arduino Uno (although other boards should work)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard
- 5 Jumper Wires
- USB A (male) to USB B (male) Cable
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Compile and Run
Set up the components according to the [Schematic](#schematic) below.

Next, open [morse_code_player.ino](morse_code_player/morse_code_player.ino) in the Arduino IDE. Please note, this file must be within a folder named "morse_code_player". At the top of the code, enter the text you want it to play and the Morse Code speed you want to it to use. Finally, connect your Arduino board to your computer with the USB cable and press "Upload" in the IDE.
